# How to create worlds?
1. every world needs an infoboard and a playing area enclosed by walls as '#' -> see examples in worlds/
2. enemies placed as 'Z'
   all neighboring enemies will convert into an array of coordinates i.e. track to move along back and forth
3. coins placed as 'O'
4. portal placed as 'X'
   one world may contain many portals all having the next common target world
   by touching 'X' the player teleports to the next world in repeated order defined in Program.cs
5. place <yourcustomworld>.txt inside worlds/ directory
6. inside Program.cs set new array containing paths to custom worlds and player starting positions (x, y) beginning at index 0
example:
  worlds = new World[] {World.createFromFile("worlds/<yourcustomworld1>.txt", (1, 8)),
                        World.createFromFile("worlds/<yourcustomworld2>.txt", (1, 7))};
